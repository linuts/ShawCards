# AGENTS

This repository contains the source for a small Go web application that drills the Shavian alphabet.

## Code Style
- Format Go source files with `gofmt -w`.
- Use two spaces for indentation in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files.

## Testing
- Run `go test ./...` before committing to ensure the project builds (currently there are no tests).

## Commit Guidelines
- Use imperative mood commit messages, e.g. `Add feature`.
